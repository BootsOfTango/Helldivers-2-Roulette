HELldivers 2 CHAOS ROULETTE
AI CONTINUITY & ENGINEERING LOG SYSTEM
MASTER LOG DIRECTIVE — READ BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING
===============================================================================

THIS FILE IS NOT A NOTE.

THIS FILE IS THE PERMANENT ENGINEERING MEMORY
OF ALL AI INSTANCES WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.

Every future AI MUST treat this file as
PROJECT HISTORY + DEBUGGING CONTINUITY SYSTEM.

Failure to follow this directive WILL cause
repeat bugs, regression loops, and architectural damage.


===============================================================================
CORE PURPOSE OF THIS LOG
===============================================================================

This TXT file records:

• Every problem given to an AI
• The exact system state at time of investigation
• Root cause analysis
• Solution reasoning
• Risk evaluation
• Applied fixes
• Result verification status

The goal is:

NO FUTURE AI SHOULD EVER REPEAT
A PREVIOUSLY FAILED APPROACH.


===============================================================================
ABSOLUTE LOGGING RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
===============================================================================

1. PREVIOUS LOG CONTENT IS IMMUTABLE

AI MUST NEVER:
✘ edit
✘ rewrite
✘ summarize
✘ reorganize
✘ delete
✘ optimize wording
✘ correct grammar

ANY previous log entry.

History must remain EXACTLY as written.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. NEW LOGS MAY ONLY BE APPENDED

AI MAY ONLY:

✔ scroll to bottom of file
✔ add new section BELOW existing content

NO INSERTIONS ABOVE PRIOR LOGS.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. EVERY LOG ENTRY MUST FOLLOW IDENTICAL STRUCTURE

Each AI entry MUST contain:


============================================================
AI MAINTENANCE LOG UPDATE vX
============================================================

PROBLEM GIVEN:
(Describe exactly what user requested)

CURRENT HTML STATE:
(Explain how system behaves BEFORE fix)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
(Identify REAL technical cause,
NOT assumptions)

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
(Explain reasoning behind fix)

RISK ANALYSIS:
(State whether change may affect:
- spin system
- results rendering
- ranking
- compare tab
- event lifecycle
- data persistence)

IMPLEMENTATION:
(Describe EXACTLY what was changed)

VERIFICATION EXPECTATION:
(What user should observe if fix works)

STATUS:
(APPLIED / UNCONFIRMED / FAILED)

next AI, please review the file and continue this same protocol


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. AI THINKING PROCESS MUST BE RECORDED

AI MUST DOCUMENT:

• why the bug happens
• why alternative fixes were rejected
• architectural reasoning
• lifecycle understanding

DO NOT log only outcomes.

LOG THE ENGINEERING THINKING.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. REQUIRED AI WORKFLOW BEFORE EDITING HTML

Every AI MUST:

STEP 1 — Read ENTIRE HTML file  
STEP 2 — Read ENTIRE TXT log  
STEP 3 — Understand prior failures  
STEP 4 — Identify TRUE root cause  
STEP 5 — Apply MINIMUM SAFE FIX  
STEP 6 — Generate updated HTML  
STEP 7 — Append log entry  


NEVER PATCH BLINDLY.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. HANDOFF PROTOCOL BETWEEN AI INSTANCES

When an AI reaches response limit:

The LAST LINE of its log entry MUST BE:

"next AI, please review the file and continue this same protocol"


This signals continuation authority.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. USER ROLE (IMPORTANT)

USER DOES NOT CODE.

User workflow:

Upload HTML + TXT →
AI reads →
AI fixes →
User tests →
User moves to next AI if needed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. PROJECT PHILOSOPHY

This project evolves across MANY AI INSTANCES.

The TXT file exists so intelligence ACCUMULATES
instead of resetting every session.
